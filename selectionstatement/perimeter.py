# Program to calculate Area and Perimeter of a Circle (without import)

# Taking input from user
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

# Value of pi
pi = 3.14

# Calculating area and perimeter
area = pi * radius * radius
perimeter = 2 * pi * radius

# Displaying results
print("Area of the circle =", area)
print("Perimeter (Circumference) of the circle =", perimeter)
